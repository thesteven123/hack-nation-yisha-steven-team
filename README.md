  AgentsDock brings <strong>Claude Code</strong>, <strong>Codex</strong>,
  <strong>Cursor</strong>, and <strong>OpenCode</strong> into one desktop and
  mobile workspace. Use your agents for coding, research, and long-running work
  without living in a terminal. Easily review files and rich media.

    AgentsDock is the client; AgentsServer is the self-hosted backend.

## What you can do

- **Work with your agents:** start and resume chats, follow live activity, and
  queue the next task.
- **Ask a side question:** Codex Side chat has independent model and reasoning
  controls, live activity, and Stop/Clear actions alongside your main chat.
- **Review the results:** view images and videos inline, browse files, inspect
  code changes, and download artifacts.
- **Keep long-running work organized:** group chats, search history, create
  digests, and schedule recurring jobs.
- **Open a real terminal:** use a persistent tmux terminal attached to each
  chat's workspace.
- **Move between devices and servers:** connect multiple clients to the same
  server, or manage several servers from one app.

## How it works

**AgentsDock is the client. AgentsServer is the self-hosted backend.** Install
the server on the machine that has your projects and agent CLIs. That can be
the same computer as the desktop app or a remote machine you control. The
desktop and mobile apps connect to it to send tasks and display results.

The agent CLIs must be installed and authenticated **on the server**, not on
your phone. Self-hosting gives you control of the server and stored history;
it does not make the models local. Your selected provider still processes
model requests, and clients may cache content on your devices. Available
providers and features depend on the client and server version.

## Get started

1. **Install the app.** Get a desktop build from
   [public GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ZhengyiLuo/AgentsDock/releases)
   ([current stable: 1.0.9](https://github.com/ZhengyiLuo/AgentsDock/releases/tag/v1.0.9)),
   or find the current iPhone/iPad distribution link on
   [the website](https://agentsdock.net/#downloads).
2. **Set up AgentsServer.** Direct macOS and Linux builds provide
   **Set up AgentsServer**. For a fresh manual installation on Linux or Apple
   silicon macOS, install Node.js/npm and
   [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), then run:

   ```sh
   npx @agentsdock/server install
   ```

   This installs the latest stable server, normally on port **7850**. Run it as
   the user who will own the server, without `sudo`. Existing installations
   use the app's managed updates; this command refuses existing server state.
   See [server setup and prerequisites](server/README.md#get-started).
3. **Connect and start a chat.** Add the server connection in AgentsDock,
   using the URL and access token printed by the installer. Install the agent
   CLI you want on the server, then sign in or configure a supported API
   connection in **Settings → My Agents** on desktop. Choose an agent and a
   working directory on the server, and send a task.

**Already using AgentsDock?** Update the desktop app from Settings. After
relaunch, 1.0.9 coordinates each supported server's matching signed update;
busy servers wait until idle, and offline servers resume after reconnecting.
The signed 1.0.9 server bridge remains available for supported older
installations. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ZhengyiLuo/AgentsDock/releases/tag/v1.0.9)
for upgrade validation limits.

For remote access, use a private network such as Tailscale rather than exposing
the server directly to the internet. The server needs `tmux` for persistent
terminals; see its documentation for the full prerequisites. Connection help
is in the [setup guide](https://agentsdock.net/setup.html).

## Develop from source

Use Git, **Node.js 24**, and **pnpm 11.9.0** (the version pinned by the project).
Desktop and mobile are separate packages; install dependencies in the package
you are working on. You also need a running AgentsServer to use the app.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZhengyiLuo/AgentsDock.git
cd AgentsDock
```

### Desktop

The current desktop app is built with Electron, React, and TypeScript. From
the repository root:

```bash
cd electron
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm build` compiles the app without packaging or publishing it. For desktop
architecture and platform-specific packaging, see
[electron/README.md](electron/README.md).

### Mobile: iPhone, iPad, and Android source

The current iPhone/iPad app lives in **`mobile-react/`**, using React Native
and Expo. Android source and native modules live in that same package. From
the repository root:

```bash
cd mobile-react
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test:history
pnpm test:server-setup
```

For local iOS development on macOS with Xcode, continue in `mobile-react/`:

```bash
pnpm exec expo prebuild --platform ios
pnpm exec expo run:ios
```

Use a simulator or your own signing configuration. Read the
[mobile development guide](mobile-react/README.md) before installing on a
device: using the existing bundle identifier can replace your installed app.
Android development requires the Android toolchain.

## Where things live

| Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`electron/`](electron/) | Current desktop client for macOS, Linux, and Windows |
| [`mobile-react/`](mobile-react/) | Current React Native mobile client, including native modules in `modules/` |
| [`website/`](website/) | Product website and user guides |
| [`team-hub/`](team-hub/) | Team Hub service code and tests |
| [`docs/`](docs/) | Architecture, development notes, and release-channel documentation |
| [`server/`](server/) | Maintained AgentsServer runtime, installer, and server-only tests |
| `Sources/`, `Apps/`, `ZenithDock.xcodeproj` | Legacy Swift clients, not the current Electron or React Native apps |

The maintained backend lives in `server/`. Its Python dependencies and installer
are self-contained; server users do not need to build either client. See
[the source migration notes](docs/SERVER_SOURCE_MIGRATION.md) before exporting
changes or preparing a coordinated release.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for checks and contribution guidelines.
Keep changes scoped and add regression tests where appropriate. Use synthetic
test data; do not commit credentials, private infrastructure details, chat
transcripts, or screenshots containing user data.

The repository's CI verifies source. It does not publish desktop releases,
upload mobile builds, or deploy servers. Official binaries and update feeds
are managed separately; see [release channels](docs/DIRECT_RELEASES.md).
